//linear search - sequentially checks each element in the list until the target
// value is found or the end of the list is reached. If the target
// is found, the algorithm returns its index; otherwise, it returns
// a value indicating the target is not present.

//TIME COMPLXITY - 
//BEST - O(1)   - only 1 comparison is needed    
//WORST - O(N)  - iterate till last item and still cant find the element  

//QUES - How many checks will the loop make in the best case ie element found at nth index
//arr=[8,9,11,12,18,...200 elements]
//target = 8
